# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots,
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +. like 1.2.13+4
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/langs/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/fonts/
    - assets/resources/
    - assets/secret/
  #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: SourceSansPro
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/SourceSansPro-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/SourceSansPro-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/SourceSansPro-Italic.ttf
          style: italic
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/SourceSansPro-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/fonts/SourceSansPro-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/SourceSansPro-Black.ttf
          weight: 900
