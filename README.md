*NB: from develop branch can start also a `fix/<branch-name>` and from release branch can start a `bugfix/<branch-name>`*

## Create Issue
1. Select a **type label** (feture, fix, bugfix, hotfix), a priority label, the milestone and the project
2. Select the **assignee** *(Do this after the selection of a type label: **a github action creates for you an associated branch**)*
3. In a terminal run `git fetch` to update the list of branch

### BranchName Convention
- from develop (default branch): `feature/<issue-number>-<issue-name>` `fix/<issue-number>-<issue-name>`
- from release: `bugfix/<issue-number>-<issue-name>`
- from master: `hotfix/<issue-number>-<issue-name>`

## Pull Request
1. When you create a pull request **include in the message a [keyword](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/github/managing-your-work-on-github/closing-issues-using-keywords#about-issue-references)** (ex: `Close #1` this comment automitally closes the issue when you merge the PR). Select a reviewer.
2. **Select the project**
3. When the reviewer approves your PR, **merge it** *(I suggest you to use squash and delete branch to remove useless branch)*
